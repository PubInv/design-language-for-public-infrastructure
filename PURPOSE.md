# Purpose

This repo exists to explore the concept of creating a common, shared, resuable "design language" for public infrastructure.
By that we mean the overlapping fields of humanitarian engineering, open source software, open hardware, public invention, and 
cooperative nonprofit work in general.

Infrastructure means tools and resources that undergird society and human wealth, weal, and well-being. The Public Infastructure is
the "commons" of the infrastructure, that is, those resources that can be used by all freely. At one time this meant
common meadows that could be grazed freely; now it means parks and roads. But it also includes software, Wikipedia, accpeted standards,
stories and characters like Romeo and Juliet, and event inventions.

# The Need for a Design Language and Unbrand

We seek to communicate more effectively. We want people to be able to understand or guess when a resource is a part of infrastructure
to make it easier for them to use it.

This is similar to an "unbrand"---a mark or logo that shows association with a useful commonality, even though the organizations
that participate in the unbrand do not know each other. The "brand" tells you to maker but the "unbrand" tells you the rules.
